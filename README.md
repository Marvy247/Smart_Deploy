# Smart Deploy

## Project Description
Smart Deploy is a DevInfra-as-a-Service platform designed to provide Solidity smart contract developers with a zero-configuration toolchain to build, test, deploy, verify, and monitor their contracts seamlessly. The platform abstracts away the complexities of smart contract development workflows by integrating Foundry for contract development and testing, and a modern TypeScript-based CLI, backend, and frontend stack for deployment, verification, monitoring, and dashboarding.

## Features and Core Components
- **Smart Contract Development (Foundry):** Fast compilation, testing, and debugging of Solidity contracts.
- **CLI Tool:** Command-line interface for building, deploying, verifying, and monitoring contracts.
- **Deployment Service:** Supports deployment to multiple Ethereum-compatible networks.
- **Verification Service:** Automates contract source verification on block explorers like Etherscan.
- **Monitoring Service:** Tracks contract events and transactions with real-time alerts.
- **Dashboard:** Web interface built with Next.js for managing projects and monitoring contracts.
- **CI/CD Integration:** Automated workflows using GitHub Actions for testing, deployment, and verification.

## Technology Stack
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity, Foundry
- **CLI & Backend:** Node.js, TypeScript
- **Frontend Dashboard:** Next.js, React, TypeScript
- **Blockchain Interaction:** ethers.js or web3.js
- **Verification:** Etherscan API or similar services
- **Monitoring:** Event listeners, WebSocket providers
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

## Project Structure Overview
- `packages/cli`: CLI tool for interacting with the platform.
- `packages/backend`: Backend services for deployment, verification, and monitoring.
- `packages/frontend`: Next.js-based dashboard for project management and monitoring.
- `src/` and `script/`: Solidity contracts and Foundry scripts.
- `lib/forge-std`: Foundry standard library for Solidity development.
- Configuration and build files at the root level.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Smart\ Deploy
   ```
2. Install dependencies for all packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Install Foundry (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
   foundryup
   ```

## Usage Instructions
- **Build and Test Contracts:**
  ```bash
  forge build
  forge test
  ```
- **CLI Commands:**
  Use the CLI tool to build, deploy, verify, and monitor contracts:
  ```bash
  npm run cli -- <command>
  ```
- **Dashboard:**
  Start the frontend dashboard:
  ```bash
  npm run dev --workspace=frontend
  ```
- **Backend:**
  Start backend services:
  ```bash
  npm run dev --workspace=backend
  ```
